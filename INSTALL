Installation instructions:

IRCbot doesn't have any special requirements about libraries or tools that
are required. You only need working C compiler with C99 standard support
(usualy gcc) and basic header files including linux kernel headers.

To make ircbot binary and all plugins, just type

$ make

When compilation finishes, you must install binaries into directory tree
to be able to run ircbot.
By default, ircbot installs into the same directory as the sources are.
If you want to change this, change value of variable PREFIX= in Makefile.

$ make install

Note: You must have permissions to write to destination directory.

Now you can run ircbot by typping ./ircbot.

Also you may want to look at configuration file (ircbot.cfg) where
you can specify various configuration options.

When the bot starts, you should be able to connect to administration interface
via telnet using local port 12345 (default behavior, can be changed in
config).

If you want to uninstall ircbot, just type

$ make uninstall

All binary files will be removed, but configuration will be kept.
